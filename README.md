# neovim-configuration
my neovim configuration (based on nvchad, using with neovide)

To use nvim the way I do:
1) install nvim (I use v0.9.4)
2) install nvchad 
3) don't forget to change your terminal default font to some kind of Nerd font, I use "FireCode Nerd Font"
4) install neovide (it makes everything in nvim silky smooth) 
5) change lua.init file to the one i have in this repository
6) open your project directory with neovide command
7) enjoy
